        <title>split it out</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;其实，我只是想随便吐槽一下，写到哪儿算哪儿，并没有什么重要的标题&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;关于抢票的一些个人看法&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最近几天上班的时候，总是在固定的时间要把手头的工作停一停，毕竟年底了，人家也要放假回家的啦，但是，鉴于公司龟速一般的网速，和12306十五渣一样的网站，真的是一张坐票都木有，虽说俺地老家离北京也不算太远吧，但哥们，您好歹给我张坐票啊？每年春节回家，我的是站着会，大包小裹的就不敢奢想了，但屁大点儿地儿，站着也不舒服啊，过道里一挤，还老有抱怨社会的，素质什么的，我就不提了，唉，那用户体验差的，要是火车有用户评价系统，哥们我差评满满的，统统一星差评，别整那些没用的，年年都这样，不能因为我长得苗条就让我站着回家吧？腿长就没理了嘛？麻麻，我也想要张坐票嘛。。。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12306的运行机制，我也说不好，毕竟在程序界，我也就一小白，但尼玛这百万雄师过大江的阵势，好歹也是见过哒，买个票整的和高考似的，这是要愁死宝宝的节奏嘛？这货要是靠点击量赚钱，那铁定能上时代周刊封面了，图片我都给您想好了&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sio_img1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;票务系统能不能不要使用这种队列的形式呀？几乎是在同一个时间点，接受超过上万次的请求，对于这些请求，已经是一种超负荷的存在了，每一个请求都会被塞入一个队列中，FIFO的方式相比大家也懂，但您当您那是偷吃佛祖灯油的老鼠精的无底洞嘛？来一个就塞一个？每一个操作就是一次请求，对于上万次的请求，就需要有上万次的响应，请求与响应也会因网络状态而有所不同，对于上万个结点的请求方式，您拿了纳税人辣么多毛爷爷，您就不能想出个对策来吗？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根据我的推测呢，您老大概用的是这种方式来处理订单的&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sio_img2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
您那强大的队列在用户的体验上的效果真的很差啊，也许对于一个很短的队列来说，并算不上什么，反正CPU那个核（hu）无非就是一个放入队列，一个处理队列逻辑，但无限长的队列，您这个“CUP(CPU)”是不就不够大了，您一个B罩杯的，能满足大爷我想要的D罩杯的手感吗？还不赶紧去垫硅胶？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其实我暂时能想到的，并不是这种队列的形式，因为对于同一时间的上网次的请求，应该就像飞夺泸定桥的那个画面一样，一个一个过，无非就是前面的是炮灰，后面的有可能要被挤掉的情形吧？&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman&#39;s earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there&#39;s no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That&#39;s how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/img/post-sample-image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Post Sample Image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there&#39;s no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That&#39;s how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
